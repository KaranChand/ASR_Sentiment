f_ans001aen;[non-verbal] I don't know what's happening, I'm sorry.
f_ans003aen;It's more like having a presentiment, do you know what I'm saying?
f_ans004aen;Don't touch me, better if you don't.
f_ans005aen;In Wellfleet, you were there, we were all there.
f_ans007sen;Yes, but they were new arrivals. New women were arriving all the time. So the [non-verbal] ...
f_ans009ben;I got really scared.
f_ans010aen;You're not doing this move just for me, are you? I mean ...
f_ans012aen;Please, talk to me, tell me what happened.
f_ans019aen;I can't tell you. Someone might get hurt.
f_ans021aen;It was once, it's not anymore.
f_ans030aen;I'd been sleeping with him, and I was out on the back porch.
f_ans032aen;You can't. There's kids.
f_ans040aen;All his talk. So much trouble.
f_ans041aen;He's been sleeping nights down in the Hooverville.
f_ans041ben;My brother didn't have room for both him and us.
f_ans042aen;Mike said, you know, if he had to stay down there anyway.
f_ans042ben;He was gonna try to get everybody organized.
f_ans043aen;Something's wrong Jim, I know it.
f_ans044aen;Now I'm here and there's some trouble in Hooverville.
f_ans044ben;He wouldn't leave me and the baby for this long.
f_ans045aen;I didn't know who else to come to Jim.
f_ans048aen;No, but I think that they saw me.
f_ans049aen;It didn't mean anything to me at the time.
f_ans050aen;But rather I didn't know what it meant.
f_ans901aen;But it's impossible.
f_ans901ben;Never allow such an aberration, believing in the dead.
f_ans901cen;I will only meet you at the end of eternity.
f_ans902aen;It wasn't her.
f_ans902ben;It was the old woman.
f_ans902cen;With strange eyes she was imitating my daughter's voice.
f_ans902den;I'd swear to God that it wasn't my daughter.
f_ans902een;Oh God, God help me.
f_ans902fen;I don't know what's the matter with me.
f_ans903aen;They know I'd never hurt them, I [non-verbal] ...
f_ans999aen;It's in the hands of some physician I have never even met.
f_ans999ben;I mean, of course I'm worried about Ray.
f_ans999cen;If anything, he's not good with this stuff. [non-verbal]
f_dis008aen;Telling me that she's always complaining, that's not picking on her? I think so.
f_dis010aen;I'm saying, Vanessa, that even crazy people like to be asked.
f_dis016aen;Yeah, whoopee.
f_dis024aen;Sweetheart, I do love you, but sometimes I have to wonder if you really are my ...
f_dis025aen;You've always been more like your father.
f_dis026aen;What is it exactly that you want?
f_dis027aen;You can give me the gun or give me back the money.
f_dis027ben;And I'm really hoping for the money.
f_dis028aen;Can I have them?
f_dis036aen;My father is from Puerto Rico. My mother is from El Salvador.
f_dis036ben;Neither one of those is Mexico.
f_dis037aen;I don't know. Isn't she sick?
f_dis038aen;I thought sick people sometimes make things up.
f_dis039aen;A woman you were treating killed her husband.
f_dis042aen;Why are you buying this land, Mr. Bloom?
f_dis043aen;Instead of buying a convertible, you buy a town?
f_dis108aen;That wasn't a question.
f_dis150aen;And you can do anything, right?
f_dis202aen;And before today, you had never heard of me?
f_dis204aen;Has she died or something?
f_dis205aen;One time an assistant left the desk because she sliced her hand open with a letter opener.
f_dis901aen;Oh you'd have saved your heads being chopped off by the Romans, that's true.
f_dis902aen;So you both would have lied to the point of denying Christ?
f_gio009aen;I just want you to come to California with me.
f_gio011aen;Congratulations on your unfettered ascendancy at Wyant Wheeler.
f_gio012aen;Oh thank you Miss Burton, now ...
f_gio012ben;Take that note under consideration.
f_gio014aen;Well that's a big surprise. [non-verbal]
f_gio016aen;I'm not a psycho.
f_gio017aen;She didn't call me Emily, isn't that great?
f_gio030aen;It is you.
f_gio034aen;Clearer than that.
f_gio040aen;One night he climbed over the bar and offered to teach me how to make them.
f_gio045aen;This is wonderful.
f_gio049aen;I told them I had to spend the evening with him.
f_gio049ben;Britain's premier equestrian journalist.
f_gio101aen;It's just hot in here, that's all.
f_gio120aen;Oh, I thought you meant the judge! [non-verbal]
f_gio123aen;Thanks a lot!
f_gio125aen;Will you relax? I know it's a big deal day.
f_gio126aen;Oh that's all.
f_gio133aen;I thought you might be in the middle of some tempestuous romance.
f_gio144aen;Happy Birthday! [non-verbal]
f_gio162aen;No ... [non-verbal] yeah!
f_gio202aen;Do you write about Sister Drummond?
f_gio203aen;Do you write about me?
f_gio204aen;Can I look?
f_gio206aen;It's nice.
f_gio207aen;Is that such a bad thing boss?
f_gio208aen;I gotta agree I am embarrassing myself.
f_gio209aen;Thirty-one until my next birthday.
f_gio210aen;Beautiful.
f_gio211aen;I love London.
f_gio212aen;What's it mean?
f_gio214aen;... wait until he got around to it.
f_gio999ben;I seem to be in some strange sort of mood.
f_rab003aen;Where are you?
f_rab007aen;My two little daughters singing stupid fucking songs from those stupid fucking commercials.
f_rab008aen;No such obligation!
f_rab009aen;Everywhere I am attended by doctors who inform me of my own interests!
f_rab010aen;I'm dying in this town.
f_rab012aen;The entire British press got up this morning and thought: 'I know where Anna Scott is'.
f_rab012ben;She's in that house with the blue door in Notting Hill.
f_rab012cen;In your goddamn underwear.
f_rab013aen;I come to you to protect myself against more crappy gossip and now I've just landed in it all over again.
f_rab013ben;For God's sake, I've got a boyfriend.
f_rab014aen;And now tomorrow there'll be pictures of you in every newspapers from here to Timbuktu.
f_rab015aen;All right, this is the perfect situation for you, isn't it?
f_rab015ben;Minimum input, maximum publicity.
f_rab015cen;Everywhere you go people will say: 'Oh well done, you've slept with that actress'.
f_rab015den;We saw the picture.
f_rab027aen;What is your obsession with this money?
f_rab029aen;You're afraid that I won't love you back.
f_rab037aen;You realize this is probably the most valuable thing we own.
f_rab042aen;I want to know when the hell you're coming home, now!
f_rab064aen;You leave her alone!
f_rab068aen;Change on the inside!
f_rab068ben;Take chances, make mistakes.
f_rab069aen;Yes! Sometimes it's important not to be perfect, okay? It's important to do the wrong thing.
f_rab070aen;No, to make them.
f_rab070ben;To find out what's real and what's not. To find out what you feel.
f_rab082aen;No boxing out of the house. All right?
f_rab082ben;No boxing. Period!
f_rab083aen;You're gonna stay in school.
f_rab083ben;And then you're gonna go to college and you're gonna have professions.
f_rab083cen;Because you're not gonna have your skulls smashed in too!
f_rab084aen;Do you understand me?
f_rab084ben;Is that clear?
f_rab087aen;But you find a way out of that fight. Break your hand again if you have to.
f_rab089cen;Well I got scared and I didn't say anything. And ten seconds later I had a gun in my face.
f_rab090ben;And this time it'd be really fucking great if you acted like you actually gave a shit.
f_rab092aen;Do you have any idea how that felt?
f_rab092ben;To have that pig's hands all over me.
f_rab098aen;It doesn't make sense that you are sitting here doing this all day long.
f_rab099aen;The case is over.
f_rab102aen;Bullshit John, it is splashed all over you. It's gonna follow you around forever.
f_rab104aen;But that seems hard for you.
f_tri002aen;I could have stopped him.
f_tri004aen;I was aware that he would sometimes ...
f_tri004ben;Wake up.
f_tri005aen;Crawl out of bed.
f_tri005ben;And walk about.
f_tri006aen;He could open the baby gate.
f_tri009aen;Will this just go on and on?
f_tri032cen;Those things.
f_tri039aen;Briony, there isn't much time.
f_tri039ben;Robbie has to report for duty at six.
f_tri039cen;And he's got a train to catch.
f_tri040aen;I'm very, very sorry.
f_tri040ben;For the terrible distress that I've caused.
f_tri040cen;I'm very, very sorry.
f_tri046aen;He said that if you said that ...
f_tri046ben;He has commitment papers for me to sign.
f_tri047aen;Would you have hurt me, John?
f_tri049aen;But my, my girls, I just ...
f_tri055aen;It's great here, it's really great. [non-verbal]
f_tri055ben;I don't know, I went to this shrine today.
f_tri056aen;There were these monks and they were chanting.
f_tri056ben;And ... I didn't feel anything.
f_tri057aen;Nothing, it's okay. I'll call you later, okay?
f_tri071aen;Do I make her proud?
f_tri081aen;Jim, you didn't see.
f_tri081ben;You weren't here.
f_tri091ben;You would take me there with you.
f_tri094aen;I only wish I were part of it.
f_tri095ben;Then we must end this.
f_tri096aen;Without that family, you could never have written anything like this.
f_tri096ben;You need them.
m_ans001aen;It just bled like hell.
m_ans002aen;This guy tried to mug me and I swung on him and he sliced me.
m_ans003aen;So I'm walking to my car.
m_ans003ben;I say I don't smoke. He says neither does he.
m_ans003cen;My heart starts clocking a buck fifty because there is no one around but me and him.
m_ans007aen;The mugger! I see how your mind's working.
m_ans007ben;I come home with blood on me the same night Katie's murdered.
m_ans007cen;I must have killed her, right?
m_ans008aen;I can't trust my mind anymore, Celeste. I'm warning you.
m_ans013aen;I don't know.
m_ans014aen;My name is Very Fucking Confused. What's your name?
m_ans014ben;What's going on here?
m_ans015ben;I went to bed in my shithole apartment and woke up in an actual shithole.
m_ans016aen;This is what they do man. They kidnap you and drug you.
m_ans016ben;Before you know it, you're lying in a bathtub and your kidneys are on eBay.
m_ans017aen;I'm not gonna risk breaking it. You throw me your tape!
m_ans018aen;Probably a joke, right?
m_ans020aen;Who is that?!
m_ans020ben;Who's in there?!
m_ans020cen;Come out!
m_ans020den;I'll kill you, you motherfucker!
m_ans021aen;Who is this?
m_ans022aen;Yeah baby, it's me. I'm here.
m_ans030aen;With all due respect, this is preposterous! It doesn't make any sense!
m_ans101aen;What is that smell?
m_ans103aen;I need you!
m_ans103cen;Lawrence, get up!
m_ans104aen;Thank God! I thought you were dead!
m_ans105aen;I told you. The same thing happened to me, see?
m_ans105ben;I wasn't lying, see?
m_ans107aen;Help! Someone help me!
m_ans123aen;Probably dead.
m_ans124aen;Who's that?
m_ans124ben;Who's that?
m_ans150aen;Lawrence, get up!
m_dis001aen;You know it's like saying: 'It's not a riot, it's rage. It's not crime, it's poverty.'
m_dis002aen;Look at this sorry, miserable, squashed thing.
m_dis002ben;Can anybody tell me what's wrong with this picture?
m_dis003aen;Well, [non-verbal], let's see.
m_dis003ben;On my sixth birthday, my best friend at the time, Scott Tibbs, stabbed me with a rusty nail.
m_dis004aen;What I saw was you get into your car. That's it.
m_dis004cen;I don't know how I got here, I don't know how you got here.
m_dis005aen;Really? Obviously this cop thinks you are the one behind it all.
m_dis008ben;I keep regular office hours if there's any further information you might need on sayings, common phrases ...
m_dis008cen;My door's wide open.
m_dis011aen;Well, I'll make a note of it. Anything else I can do for you?
m_dis013aen;You include me out. I've had enough of the convocations.
m_dis014aen;And it seems you do too.
m_dis015aen;Mother, I'm a very busy man.
m_dis015ben;I do not have time to help ... it pursue some ridiculous lawsuit.
m_dis016aen;Well, that's mutation, Mother. The miracle of genetics is I'm not you.
m_dis017aen;So you'd be gone for quite a long time.
m_dis018ben;I live with you. I know how much you study, or I should say don't study. And you do better than me.
m_dis020aen;I will save lives that could have otherwise not been saved.
m_dis021aen;You know, maybe I am. But you ask the average person ...
m_dis021ben;When death comes knocking at their door ... whether they want a prick on their side.
m_dis023ben;Is it because your father was a doctor and his father was a doctor, some sort of genetic thing?
m_dis027ben;People are good. Trust people?
m_dis031ben;Maybe you got a bunch of fat and happy fighters at home ... can afford to rest a month between bouts. I don't know. Lucky you! 
m_dis035aen;Saddam. His, his name's Saddam? Well that's, that's real good Bruce.
m_dis044aen;I misplaced an important complaint. That's their story.
m_dis044ben;Wanna hear mine?
m_gio001aen;He's an idiot.
m_gio001ben;He's always been an idiot.
m_gio002aen;Great. Thanks.
m_gio002ben;Wish me luck.
m_gio003aen;On for a video fest tonight?
m_gio003ben;I got some absolute classics.
m_gio005aen;Come on, one dance!
m_gio010aen;You told me every other fucking thing.
m_gio014aen;Everybody has their own idea of what they think paradise is. [non-verbal]
m_gio018aen;Relax, it's okay. There is no point in being nuts if you can't have a little fun.
m_gio022aen;Gee, I love you guys.
m_gio023aen;For the first time in eighteen years I'm going to be able to call the shots in my own life. Oh my God!
m_gio034aen;Well, as often as they can.
m_gio041aen;Jesus H. Christ!
m_gio041ben;Jesus, Mary and Joseph!
m_gio046aen;You know, I might as well get an Ahooga horn and chase him around the ring.
m_gio049aen;You think because of that, the audience won't recognize him as being a black man?
m_gio058aen;Mr. Wheeler, you are magnificent.
m_gio062aen;I get your logic. Demi-capu coming right up.
m_gio100aen;That's some of the best shit I've ever heard come out of your mouth.
m_gio101aen;Give the guy a break.
m_gio102aen;I don't know. The girls like it.
m_gio103aen;Is that any way to talk to a guest? A friend of the family?
m_gio105aen;Fucking A. Back from the dead.
m_gio106aen;Fifty fucking pounds, man.
m_gio107aen;I'm telling you, man, this kid is awesome as hell.
m_gio108aen;I lost count, man.
m_gio108ben;Doesn't matter, man.
m_gio111aen;Make that second most beautiful invention!
m_gio129aen;I'd feel a bit of a fool handing it over myself.
m_gio130aen;[non-verbal] I just use it for clean-up.
m_gio135aen;[non-verbal] I gotta go see about a girl.
m_gio140aen;Everybody has their own idea of what they think paradise is. [non-verbal]
m_gio140ben;The wife thinks it's paradise.
m_gio144aen;So I shared that with you.
m_gio144ben;And one night it was so loud it woke the dog up.
m_gio145aen;Well, like I say, they make me ask. You understand.
m_rab002aen;A walk!
m_rab002ben;Is that all? Just a walk.
m_rab005den;You've tried to kill yourself twice.
m_rab006aen;It was done for you!
m_rab006ben;It was done for your betterment!
m_rab006cen;It was done out of love!
m_rab010ben;And it fucking pisses me off!
m_rab021aen;Shut the fuck up!
m_rab021ben;This is my daughter I'm talking about!
m_rab021cen;Everybody shut up!
m_rab021den;Shut up!
m_rab022aen;Why the hell did you think I was there?
m_rab027aen;Tell me, I'm asking: 'What is there to understand?'
m_rab050aen;Why do you think he does that, Gerry? Do you have any fucking clue why?
m_rab055aen;It's not about you, you mathematical dick!
m_rab055den;He is a good kid!
m_rab064aen;Did you hear me? Shut up!
m_rab067aen;Now you either tell me what is really going on or I'll cut you with this, you hear me? I'll cut ...
m_rab070aen;Well then don't keep me in the dark about what you're thinking!
m_rab072aen;Does that mean you saw what happened to me?
m_rab084aen;You goddamn well should!
m_rab085aen;Yes!
m_rab087aen;I don't care if you love him!
m_rab087ben;I'm telling you!
m_rab089ben;There's a bus full of dead people!
m_rab090aen;Who? Someone you know?
m_rab092aen;No, you didn't tell me.
m_rab095aen;I don't like you!
m_rab096aen;Because you make my effort a joke!
m_rab096ben;I want to be a doctor! This isn't a game to me!
m_rab097aen;This isn't playtime!
m_rab097ben;This is serious business!
m_rab102aen;How hard can that be?
m_rab115aen;Fights being stopped by referees? He's pathetic!
m_rab121aen;What does that mean?
m_rab121ben;If she's not guilty, why am I?
m_tri002aen;Makes you feel ...
m_tri002ben;... alian.
m_tri004ben;You know, after ...
m_tri004een;... then I ever was of being in ...
m_tri005aen;I loved her.
m_tri005cen;When we were sitting in that kitchen that night ...
m_tri005een;I don't want it.
m_tri007cen;She had to go meet Eve and Diane.
m_tri008aen;We were gonna leave Sunday.
m_tri008ben;We were gonna get married when we got there.
m_tri009aen;I loved her so much.
m_tri009cen;It doesn't happen twice.
m_tri011aen;But now she wants to die.
m_tri011cen;And I swear to God, Father ...
m_tri011den;It's comitting a sin by doing it.
m_tri011een;By keeping her alive I'm killing her.
m_tri011fen;Do you know what I mean?
m_tri011gen;How do I get around that?
m_tri012aen;Went to see Maggie this morning.
m_tri012ben;You must have been somewhere else.
m_tri014aen;But maybe you won't sign them.
m_tri014ben;Maybe you'll just give me some time.
m_tri014cen;I will try to figure this out.
m_tri015aen;Whatever you do, Rosen is right about one thing.
m_tri015ben;You shouldn't be here.
m_tri015cen;I'm not safe anymore.
m_tri020aen;You have a gift.
m_tri021aen;You know, they like you.
m_tri021ben;And if you leave, I can't learn this way.
m_tri025ben;Couldn't help that one.
m_tri026aen;And he can't stop thinking about Annie.
m_tri027aen;Ever since then, things have been different.
m_tri028aen;He is not the same person that he used to be.
m_tri028ben;And his wife ... doesn't like the person that he's become.
m_tri029ben;And then one day Malcom meets this wonderful little boy.
m_tri030aen;And Malcom decides to try and help this new boy.
m_tri030ben;Cause he feels that ...
m_tri030cen;... it would be like ... helping that other one too.
m_tri038aen;You have to understand. When I was growing up, he was gone more than he was there.
m_tri040aen;Maybe he never wanted a family.
m_tri041aen;Whatever it is, he likes his second life ...
m_tri041ben;... better and the reason that he tells his stories is because he can't stand this boring place.
m_tri042aen;What's true?
